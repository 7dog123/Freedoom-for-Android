Gameplay Notes          : Each of the 32 levels in this megawad was
                        : designed to be played from scratch, i.e. 
                        : 100% health, 0% armor, a pistol and 50 bullets.
                        : Playing the "normal" way from level to level 
                        : may cause some levels to become too easy as
                        : the player brings in more weapons and ammunition
                        : than the level was designed around.  For the 
                        : best gameplay experience, start each level from 
                        : scratch as you reach it, via either IDCLEV or
                        : committing suicide.
                        : Also, the levels in this WAD are in no particular
                        : order, so don't expect a progression in size or
                        : difficulty as you play through it.
                        : Finally, there are no exits to Map31 or Map32, so
                        : you'll have to IDCLEV there.

Build Time              : One month
Editor(s) used          : Various

Known Bugs              : Due to the trickery used to make a mere 10 
                        : sectors feel like many more, many of the levels
                        : are impossible to play in co-op or deathmatch
                        : mode.  Some levels may be able to be forced into
                        : an unbeatable state, necessitating a fresh start
                        : or savegame reload.

  Bassett     : Well, I have mixed feelings about this map. Lots of
              : monsters, far too many monsters. Although it makes great
              : use of ten sectors, it really doesn't look very nice. With
              : a mix of textures through tofgether in square patterns on
              : the walls. Good for length, not all that great for looks
              : and playability.

  Friberg     : Nice detail and architecture. Definately one to keep in
              : mind. I got annoyed by all structures and items which kept
              : me from backing up fighting with my fists which also kept
              : me irritated. If those weren't there I would love this map
              : even more.

  Bassett     : Pretty nice looking. This level is of decent size, and has
                good height and light variety. Looks impressive to me.

  Friberg     : It made a pretty good 1st impression on me. The absolute
              : first time I ran through it, all monsters seemed to be
              : standing on a straight line, just waiting to get their guts
              : blown away. But it grew on me and I had to try twice before
              : I could play it all the way to the end.
              : The end fight could be done way harder and some of the
              : later hallways were unecessary long and dull.
              : It felt like the author did a good job of using
              : lightsources and details at the beginning of the map but
              : forgot about it in the other parts.

  Bassett     : Rather compact. A very short level. Not much in the way of
              : looks, or gameplay. I can't find the exit.

  Friberg     : I was very much impressed of both gameplay and architecture
              : when I played the first time. The very cool tech-theme was
              : held very good throughout the whole map. But I found a few
              : very minor texture misstakes or at least, bad texture-use.

  Bassett     : Hmm. If I saw this level in a public archive, I would never
              : have guessed it only used ten sectors. The level plays very
              : long, has some good puzzles, and good ammo balance. But
              : still, detail is a little scarce. It doesn't look all that
              : nice. It might make the megawad.

  Friberg     : Nope!

  Bassett     : A Map30 remake? Oh, no.. All that red lava and all that
              : light green stone makes the level look just so easy.
              : There's more to a challenging level than simply lots of
              : monsters.

  Friberg     : Pretty cool use of the endboss. The map was pretty
              : origional IMO and deserves some credit for that, but when
              : it comes to texture-use, details and architecture it is
              : almost hopelessly boring. The greenmarble really hurt my
              : eyes like knifes. Some wood in there might have looked
              : good. Oh and never show Romero's head like that. Cover it
              : up with something. You know, you still have to keep that a
              : secret ;)

  Bassett     : This IS a pretty good level. The detail isn't too much
              : there, but it still plays great. Nice ammo balance, good
              : fun, nice fiery atmosphere. A good challenge of a level.

  Friberg     : Somewhat weird ending.. Too uneven in its quality.

  Bassett     : Wow! This is a very large level! Very, very impressive.
              : Very neat design. Lots and lots of diversity in the height!
              : Not to mention the light levels, the textures, and
              : everything else! Ammo seems a little tight, but that
              : shouldn't be a problem if it's stuck into the later levels.

  Bassett     : Now this is interesting. Lots of crates, all three keys are
              : used.. Very creative use of ten sectors. A dark techno
              : warehouse is a theme I've been craving for a while.
              : Although quick, an enjoyable level!

  Friberg     : This one felt very ... unplanned. You get dropped into a
              : chaos of crates and it is extremely hard to tell where to
              : go. Oh and you have a few arch-viles, chaingun-snipers and
              : mancubi on your back. Everything takes place in the same
              : room so use the cover wisely. This is definately the
              : toughest map so far!  When I played it a few times the
              : fighting became more fun and challenging, but the feel of
              : disorder doesn't make it topnotch.

  Bassett     : Nothing too special here. It's looks pretty nice, but the
              : level is mostly a square pattern. And then it finally
              : breaks loose into another area where the exit switch. Not
              : too much effort is required to finish the level. Ehh.

  Friberg     : Began looking pretty cool, but turned out to be just
              : boring.

  Bassett     : A good level. Some nice texture and light variations. Good
              : playability. All around, pretty good.

  Friberg     : Uhm.. ok, but nothing more. The two last arch-viles offered
              : the best games. Pretty square and boring design and
              : architecture, not that linear in layout though.

  Bassett     : This is another good level. It looks very nice, it plays
              : very nice. Still a little short, though.

  Friberg     : Another very good map! The brownstone/metal theme (idmap01)
              : is held throughout the complete map.  But why did I get the
              : plasmagun at all? I never found it before I was about to
              : run into the exit... Never got any use out of it and I had

  Bassett     : As much as I'd like to say good things about this level,
              : with its nice length and all, the combination of green
              : stone and lava, along with the achingly misaligned
              : textures, and sectional design, I would definitely not want

  Bassett     : This level is great-looking and great playing. Good puzzles
              : to solve, and good enemy/ammo balance. Should be one of my
              : top picks.

  Friberg     : Pretty cool use of the sectors and somewhat innovative.

  Bassett     : This is a pretty good level. Diverse in height, light, not
              : so much in textures, but the ammo balance is good, and it
              : isn't too terribly impossible. It's all right.

  Friberg     : Ok, but certainly not more.. Keep it in mind if lack of

  Bassett     : This is a refreshing change. We have some very good height
              : variations on this map. Not to mention texture variations,
              : and some very nice subtle lighting effects. Still, the
              : level is rather short. If you're going for 100% kills, then
              : the Spider Mastermind at the end of the level will stretch
              : things out.

  Friberg     : No real flaws here, just boring layout, architecture and
              : gameplay.  I survived the whole map and killed everything
              : with only the shotgun and chaingun. And I didn't need the
              : latter one. The rocketlauncher and plasmagun were just not
              : needed. Ok not everyone wants to kill a Spider Mastermind
              : with singleshotgun, but the author shouldn't have supplied
              : the player with so many shells if so...

  Bassett     : Hmm. Another square pattern level, with an exit tunnel. It
              : looks nice, but the main concern seems to be monster-
              : fighting, rather than puzzle solving. It kind of makes me
              : *yawn*, but it's not too bad.

  Bassett     : A decent level. Mostly flat, but some nice texture
              : variables.. And it plays reasonably long.. Ammo balance is
              : a little lax, though.. It's all right.

  Friberg     : This map was very nicely built, but the final fight is just
              : too bore-some. Too many enemies and not enough cool weapons
              : to play with.

              : detail could be better. Dare I say, the height variations
              : are good. There isn't too much ammo, which is nice. But
              : still, a little short for my tastes. Overall, it's one of

              : Sargeants!! Waiting for the pillar to come down.. Oh, it
              : takes forever. Well, not really, but it is a challenge to
              : stay alive.. They just keep coming! Okay, so the map
              : doesn't look great, and the gameplay isn't my favorite.
              : I'd say ehh.

  Friberg     : A little bit origional... 1 mancubus, zillions of zombiemen
              : being teleported into the map.. exit lowers from above.

  Bassett     : There's lots of detail in this level. Strangely enough, the
              : detail tends to stick more to the floors and ceilings,
              : rather than the walls. Its length is decent. It uses a key.
              : It's okay.

  Friberg     : Everything was ok in this one. Using the tekbrown texture 
              : (I think that was it) didn't work out that well and
              : everything seemed so big and "clumpsy."  And why was that
              : rocketlauncher there? I had two demons and two seargents

              : sectors. Still, it doesn't play all that well. Not one of

              : diverse enough as well! While playing, I completely forgot
              : that the level was only ten sectors. But still, far too
              : many monsters for the amount of ammo given. Pretty nice.

  Friberg     : Hard, even too hard if you want to kill all enemies (which

              : height. Quite impressive, for ten sectors.

  Friberg     : I am very impressed by the architecture and design but

              : the top 32, maybe. We'll see.

  Bassett     : Well, the detail isn't there. The light levels are okay.
              : But very small, and that maze doesn't help matter much.
              : *Sigh*, next..

  Bassett     : This is a decent level. But there isn't much detail, and
              : the light differences could be better. Simply too many
              : monsters, I think. It's okay, but overall, I don't think
              : it's enough for the top 32.

  Bassett     : Well, this is a small level, and it is mostly square... But
              : it does have some nice detail, and the monster/ammo balance
              : is pretty good. We might be able to use it if we need a
              : smaller level. It's okay!

  Bassett     : I'm stumped! This level is just a little bit too tricky for
              : my tastes. Requiring a little dexterity to complete the
              : level is often a missing quality, but this is just pushing!

  Friberg     : Not only was the map total crap but the puzzles were
              : impossible.

* Megawad Judging Information *

The Doomworld 10 Sectors Contest ran from August 22, 2000 to September 22, 
2000.  During that time, 138 WADs were submitted.

The judging panel originally consisted of five people: Andrew Bassett, 
Matthew Dixon, Martin Friberg, Gaston Lahaut, and Malcolm Sailor.
Unfortunately, Malcolm Sailor had to drop out due to time constraints.  The
four remaining judges then took about 5 weeks to sort through the 138 WADs,
with judging reaching completion on November 1, 2000.

The 138 submitted levels were merged into 5 megawads for judging purposes, 
with the first four containing 30 levels each and the 5th containing 18
levels.  Judges then designated their picks by saying which megawad of the 
5 the level was in, and which map slot it filled within that megawad.  The 
judges were asked to list their favorite 32, 10, 3, and 1, with levels
within the lists in no particular order.

Here are the judging results.

Mord  = Gaston Lahaut
Matt  = Matthew Dixon
AndrB = Andrew Bassett
Cocnn = Martin Friberg

* The Second 32 *

The second 32 levels out of the 138 submitted were chosen by first taking
every WAD which was chosen by either one or two judges as one of their top
32 levels.  This added up to 27 levels.  Linguica then chose 5 levels to
fill it to an even 32.
